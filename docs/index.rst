Don't be afraid to commit
#########################

A workshop/tutorial for Python/Django developers who would like to contribute
more to the projects they use, but need more grounding in some of the tools
required.

The purpose of the workshop
===========================

**Don't be afraid to commit** will help put you in a position to commit
successfully to collaborative projects. 

You'll find it particularly useful if you think you have some good coding
ideas, but find that managing the development process sometimes gets in the
way of your actual development.

virtualenv and pip; Git and GitHub
----------------------------------

**virtualen** and **pip**, and **Git** and **GitHub** will help you manage
your own work in a more streamlined and efficient way.

Automated testing
-----------------

Writing **automated tests** will help you develop your software faster,
better and more easily and give other developers more confidence in your
contributions.

Documentation
-------------

Being able to create, manage and publish **documentation** in an efficient
and orderly way will make your work more accessible and more interesting to
other people.

What we'll cover
================

The workshop will take participants through the complete cycle of identifying
a simple issue in a Django or Python project, writing a patch with tests and
documentation, and submitting it.

The workshop will take you through the use of:

* virtualenv and pip
* Git and GitHub
* running and writing tests for Python applications
* writing and building documentation using Sphinx
* submitting a pull request to the Django Project
