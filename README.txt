=========================
Don't be afraid to commit
=========================

A hands-on workshop for Python/Django developers who would like to contribute
more to the projects they use, but need more grounding in some of the tools
they need to use.

The workshop will take participants through the complete cycle of identifying
a simple issue in a Django or Python project, writing a patch with tests and
documentation, and submitting it.

The testing section of the workshop will be the most substantial component. 

The workshop will take you through the use of:

* virtualenv and pip
* git (and GitHub)
* running and writing tests for Python applications
* writing and building documentation using Sphinx
* submitting a pull request

A workbook and reference guide will be provided to support the workshop.

Date: a weekday morning or afternoon in February or March 2012
Venue: Cardiff University
Attendance fee: none
